            <h4>Deviled Eggs</h4>
            <p>Classic, creamy, and always the first appetizer to disappear—these traditional deviled eggs are a Christmas Day staple.

                Serves: 8–10
                
                <li>

                    Ingredients: 

                <ol>12 large eggs </ol>
                <ol>1/2 cup mayonnaise</ol>
                 <ol>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</ol>
                 <ol>1 teaspoon white vinegar</ol>
                 <ol>1/4 teaspoon salt</ol>
                 <ol>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</ol>
                Optional garnish: paprika or chopped parsley</ol>
                Steps:
                <ol>Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. </ol>
                <ol>Bring to a boil. </ol>
                <ol>Once boiling, remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 12 minutes.</ol>

                </li>

                Drain hot water and transfer eggs to an ice bath. Let cool completely, then peel.

                Slice eggs in half lengthwise and carefully remove yolks. Place yolks in a bowl and mash with a fork until smooth.

                Add mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper to the yolks. Mix until creamy and smooth.

                Spoon or pipe the filling back into the egg whites. Sprinkle lightly with paprika or parsley.

                    Serves: 8-12

                    
                    <li>

                        Ingredients: 

                        <ol>1 round Brie cheese (8–12 oz)</ol>

                        <ol>½ cup cranberry sauce (whole berry works best)</ol>
                        <ol>2–3 tbsp brown sugar</ol>
                        <ol>1 egg (for egg wash)</ol>
                    </li>

                    
                    <li>
                        Steps:

                        <ol>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</ol>
                        <ol>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</ol>
                        <ol>Wrap brie in puff pastry
                                Lightly flour your counter.
                                Roll the puff pastry out slightly to remove creases.
                                Place the brie in the center of the pastry.</ol>
                        <ol>Spoon cranberry sauce + brown sugar on top
                                Spoon cranberry sauce directly on top of the brie.
                                Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar.
                                Add optional nuts, herbs, or orange zest for extra depth.</ol>
                        <ol>Wrap the Brie
                                Fold the corners of the puff pastry up and over the brie.
                                Pinch gently to seal.
                                Flip seam-side down onto the baking sheet.</ol>
                        <ol>Egg Wash for Golden Color
                                Whisk the egg with 1 tbsp water.
                                Brush over the entire pastry for a glossy golden crust.</ol>
                        <ol>Bake at 375°F for 20–25 min
                                Pastry is deep golden brown
                                Cheese inside is soft and molten
                                If the pastry browns too fast, loosely tent with foil for the last 5 minutes.</ol>
                        <ol>Rest & Serve
                                Let sit 5–10 minutes before cutting (prevents cheese overflow).
                                Serve warm with:
                                Crackers
                                Sliced apples or pears
                                Toasted baguette slices
